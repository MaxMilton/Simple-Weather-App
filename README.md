A simple experiment using AngularJS, the OpenWeatherMap API, and CSS3.

# Overview

Mostly just a project to allow me to experiment with AnularJS. View a live version at http://labs.wearegenki.com/experiments/simple-weather-app/

Source code avaliable on [Github](https://github.com/MaxMilton/Simple-Weather-App).

## Interesting Points

* Get weather via the OpenWeatherMap API in a JSONP request.
* Uses the built in geolocation browser function to get the users coordinates.
* CSS3 animations on colour change and location panel show.
* Shows weather from a random city on page load.

## Development Instructions

1. Watch SCSS for changes: `npm run-script watch`
2. Start the local web server: `npm start`
3. Open a new browser tab and go to: http://localhost:8880/
